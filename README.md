# 21-machine-learning-challenge
This assignment had three requirements:
  *Preprocess a dataset to be used with Machine Learning 
  Step 1:  Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting it to the selected model
  Step 2:  Perform feature selection on remove unnecesary features
  Step 3:  Use MinMaxScaler to scale the numerical data
  *Tune the Machine Learning model parameters
  Step 1:  Use GridSearch to turn model parameters
  Step 2:  Tune and compare at least two different classifiers
  *Report the Results
  Step 1: Compare the performance of the models 
  Step 2: Summarize findings
  Step 3: Identify the models that show the best scoring in accuracy of prediction of the existence of exoplanets
